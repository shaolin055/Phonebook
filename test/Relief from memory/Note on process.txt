	Here, i am attemting to find a way to short a huge data in a short time. I have some processes, but they all are time elapsing. When i think of using RAM for better speed, shortage of memory come in front. When i wanna to use hard disk, the problem of shortage of memory overcome, but time become a factor then. For a example, if we have a 10000 of data to short, we may need just 225kb of memory taking 22.5 byte per information, but the number of loop the programme uses is too high upto 10^8. Which may cost too many time and the process is unexceptable. 
	In the programme modern, i attemted to short all "A" first and then "B","C" and so on so forth. Then i will try to short data using "AA","AB",... . Here is another problem occured. If "AA" is not there a faul nomber of loop will run then and the total number will be very high at the end for "AB","AC"... . We have to find a better soln and start here on.
